<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Abstract </h1>
A spatio-temporal stability analysis is conducted on a flow representing both jets and wakes, subject to confinement by identical compliant walls. The walls are placed at equal distances from the fluid centre line for a range of wall and flow parameters. By following the position of special saddle points (pinch points) of the dispersion relation in the complex wavenumber plane, the absolute and convective instability stability properties of the flow are determined for various system parameters. The compliant walls are shown to modify the flow-based instabilities, which exist in the rigid wall case, as well as introduce new additional instabilities originating from the presence of the wall itself. It is observed that under certain system parameters, these wall modes become the dominant instability present in the system and can induce an absolute instability into flows which are only convectively unstable when confined by rigid walls, as well as extending the region of absolute instability to large confinement parameters. Results are presented for both a piecewise linear velocity profile and a smooth velocity profile, with the results of the two studies in qualitative agreement.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> About This Page </h2>

The purpose of this page is to expand on a few areas of the poster which, due to space constraints, had to be left out. These include details on how to carry out an absolute instability analysis, what is meant by a dispersion relation and nondimensional analysis, just to name a few.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> (1,2) A Spatio-temporal Analysis and The Dispersion Relation </h3>

<p> A dispersion relation is an expression which relates a waves wavenumber, usually denoted as \(\alpha\) which represents the number of wavelengths per unit of distance and the frequency \(\omega\), which represents the number of oscillations per unit time. There are a number of ways in which one can derive a dispersion relation, though this is not something we will derive here. However, there are a number of texts we can recommend (cite). A dispersion relation is often written in the form 
\[\mathbb{D}(\alpha,\omega) \equiv 0 \] 
With this dispersion relation, one can carry out a number of instability analyses, including a temporal instability, i.e. where \(\omega \in \mathbb{C},\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\), allowing us to see how a wave can grow in time, or a spatial instability, where \(\omega \in \mathbb{R},\alpha \in \mathbb{C}\), which allows us to consider the growth of a wave in space. </p> 

<p> Now what would we find out if we were to let both \(\alpha,\omega \in \mathbb{C}\)? By doing this, we are able to carry out a spatio-temporal analysis on the system. So what does this mean, and how does it differ from a spatial or temporal instability? </p> 

<p> Unlike a spatial or temporal analysis, which consideres the growth of individual waves, a spatio-temporal analysis considers the growth of wave packets, groups of waves, in the long time limit. Furthermore, this analysis allows us to see whether a system experiances growth both up and downsteam of the initial perturbation, and growth in time. These modes, \((\alpha,\omega)\) pairs, take the form of saddle points in complex \(\alpha\)-plane, and branch points in the complex \(\omega\)-plane. These points are refered to as pinch points. (For details on carrying out such an analysis, see references)</p> 

<p> From a spatial-temporal analysis, we could have one of three outcomes:  

<ol>
  <li> Stability,</li>
  <li> Convective Instability (CI),</li>
  <li> Absolute Instability (AI). </li>
</ol>

If we have a CI, then we have decay in time and growth in space. This is effectively a spatial instability. We have an AI if we see growth in time at a given pinch point, i.e. when \(\omega_{i} >0\). It is these modes that we are most interested in.
