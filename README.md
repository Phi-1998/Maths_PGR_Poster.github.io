<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Abstract </h1>
A spatio-temporal stability analysis is conducted on a flow representing both jets and wakes, subject to confinement by identical compliant walls. The walls are placed at equal distances from the fluid centre line for a range of wall and flow parameters. By following the position of special saddle points (pinch points) of the dispersion relation in the complex wavenumber plane, the absolute and convective instability stability properties of the flow are determined for various system parameters. The compliant walls are shown to modify the flow-based instabilities, which exist in the rigid wall case, as well as introduce new additional instabilities originating from the presence of the wall itself. It is observed that under certain system parameters, these wall modes become the dominant instability present in the system and can induce an absolute instability into flows which are only convectively unstable when confined by rigid walls, as well as extending the region of absolute instability to large confinement parameters. Results are presented for both a piecewise linear velocity profile and a smooth velocity profile, with the results of the two studies in qualitative agreement.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> About This Page </h2>

The purpose of this page is to expand on a few areas of the poster which, due to space constraints, had to be left out. These include details on how to carry out an absolute instability analysis, what is meant by a dispersion relation and nondimensional analysis, just to name a few.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> 1) A Spatio-temporal Analysis </h3>

A spatio-temporal analysis is the study of both the space and time characteristics of a wave packet in the large time response. MAY HAVE TO SHUFFLE THIS TO MAKE SENSE...

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> 2) The Dispersion Relation </h3>

<p> A dispersion relation is an expression which relates a systems wavenumber, usually denoted as \(\alpha\) which represents the number of wavelengths per unit of distance and the frequency \(\omega\), which represents the number of oscillations per unit time. There are a number of ways in which one can derive a dispersion relation, though this is not something we will derive here.However, there are a number of texts we can recommend (cite). A dispersion relation is often written in the form 
\[\mathbb{D}(\alpha,\omega) \equiv 0 \]
